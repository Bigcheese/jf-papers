# C++ Standard Committee Papers

Build status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jfbastien/papers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jfbastien/papers)

Official C++ Standard Committee papers are available from [the C++ mailings][].

More information on the C++ Standard Committee is available on
[the Committee site][].

I've written a few of these papers, and have been doing so mostly using
reStructuredText and editing them through github. Papers in this repository are
final and published when numbered `N` or `P`, and are drafts when numbered
`D`. This is an ISO thing: I can't revise already-published `N` or `P`
papers. The paper revision (the `R` part in `P` numbered papers) has to be
incremented, and a new paper published.

New paper numbers are obtained through the Committee's Vice-Chair.
