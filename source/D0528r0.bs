Abstract: I was thinking how nothing lasts—especially a struct's padding bits—and what a shame that is when used with atomic compare-and-exchange.

This issue has been discussed by the authors at every recent Standards meetings,
yet a solution has been elusive. We believe that this proposal can fix this
oft-encountered problem once and for all.


Story Time {#story}
==========

The Curious Case of `struct` {#struct}
----------------------------

Using the Standard's atomic compare-and-exchange on `struct`s with padding bits
is fraught with peril: the `desired` value is passed by value to all of the
methods, which doesn't guarantee than any particular bit pattern is preserved in
the bits which don't participate in the <em>value representation</em>. the
padding bits mean that there are multiple <em>object representations</em> for
the same value representation.

Indeed:

* Object initialization doesn't guarantee any particular value for padding bits.
* Copying an object can change its padding bits, on <strong>every copy</strong>.

Whereas using compare-and-exchange acts on the <strong>entire</strong> object,
padding bits included. From 29.6.5 Requirements for operations on atomic types
[<strong>atomics.types.operations.req</strong>], ¶24:

<blockquote>
    [ <em>Note:</em> For example, the effect of `atomic_compare_exchange_strong` is
          <pre>
          if (memcmp(object, expected, sizeof(*object)) == 0)
              memcpy(object, &desired, sizeof(*object));
          else
              memcpy(expected, object, sizeof(*object));
          </pre>
    <em>— end note</em> ]
</blockquote>

Compare-and-exchange is specified this way because that's how hardware works:
`cmpxchg` or load-linked / store-conditional instuctions must operate on the
entire address range to be atomic.

The interactions between non-atomic and atomic objects which contain padding
bits means that compare-and-exchange is <strong>never</strong> guaranteed to
succeed, even if the program only ever uses a single value representation.

We've included a [[#sample]] which exhibits this behavior.

A `union` Born in Unusual Circumstances {#union}
---------------------------------------

Unions can exhibit a similar problem: they can contain padding, but can also
contain bits which don't participate in their active member's value
representation.

Points are Floating, Even `NaN`wards {#fp}
------------------------------------

Astute readers will note that value representations with multiple object
representations exist for more than simply `struct` and `union`. Even with
`std::atomic`'s requirement that objects be trivially copyable, it is possible
for boolean, signed integral and floating-point values to suffer from this
problem.

The common example where this happens is when signaling `NaN`s are present: some
platforms canonicalize them to quiet a `NaN`. This is a similar problem to
padding bits: copying can change the object representation.

Defining the Opportunities We'll Miss {#miss}
-------------------------------------

While the problem is valid for `union` and some scalar representations, the
authors believe that it is separate from that of padding bits on
`struct`s. Indeed, all `struct` with padding bits exhibit this problem, whereas
only limited scalar values are affected. The same applies for `union`: the issue
can only surface when the widest member isn't the active member (though `union`s
do suffer of the padding problem). We don't believe `std::atomic<bool>` suffers
from this problem.

Put another way: compare-and-exchange of a `struct` with padding bits is
<strong>always</strong> wrong, whereas the other similar issues are
<strong>sometimes</strong> wrong.

This leads us to two conclusions:

  1. For types with padding bits a simple solution exists using the existing
     Standard: developers should explicitly define padding members if they
     intend to compare-and-exchange a type. Were an approach such as [[N3986]]
     adopted, developers could rely on this facility to avoid padding bits more
     easily.

  2. Other types which don't have unique object representations merit another
     solution: developers should never compare-and-exchange a value which has
     multiple object representations. All other values of that type can be
     compare-and-exchanged without issue.

This paper only addresses the former.

Making the Greatest Impression {#impression}
------------------------------

Conclusion 1. above is addressable by developers, but the authors believe that
this Standard should prevent this dangerous usage of compare-and-exchange. This
is better handled as a requirement of the methods than as a QoI warning.

The authors therefore propose adding a `requires` clause to all the
compare-and-exchange functions, forbidding their usage on a type which has
padding bits. All other `std::atomic` operations would remain valid, only
compare-and-exchange would become a compilation error if used.

The Standard, if [[P0020r3]] is adopted, will specify 4 specializations for
`std::atomic`:

* `std::atomic<T>`
* `std::atomic<T*>`
* `std::atomic<integral>`
* `std::atomic<floating-point>`

Since [[P0258r2]] the Standard contains the type trait
`has_unique_object_representations`, as defined in 20.15.4.3 Type properties
[<strong>meta.unary.prop</strong>] ¶9. This trait initially seems ideally suited
to our purpose:

<blockquote>

  The predicate condition for a template specialization
  `has_unique_object_representations<T>::value` shall be satisfied if and only
  if:

  * T is trivially copyable, and

  * any two objects of type `T` with the same value have the same object
    representation, where two objects of array or non-union class type are
    considered to have the same value if their respective sequences of direct
    subobjects have the same values, and two objects of union type are
    considered to have the same value if they have the same active member and
    the corresponding members have the same value.

  The set of scalar types for which this condition holds is
  implementation-defined. [ <em>Note:</em> If a type has padding bits, the
  condition does not hold; otherwise, the condition holds true for unsigned
  integral types. <em>— end note</em> ]

</blockquote>

We could apply it to the `std::atomic<T>` variants of compare-and-exchange only,
avoiding the pointer, integral and floating-point specializations. This
unfortunately leaves out what seems like a useful case:

<xmp>
struct T {
  float a;
  float b;
};
std::atomic<T> t;
static_assert(std::has_unique_object_representations_v<T>);
</xmp>

This type typically has no padding bits, fits the `std::atomic<T>`
specialization, yet on some platforms does <strong>not</strong> have a unique
object representation because of its floating-point members. The above type is
often spelled as `std::atomic<std::complex<float>>`, which is a very useful
type, even atomically. Naïvely adding `requires
has_unique_object_representations_v<T>` on the compare-and-exchange members of
`std::atomic<T>` would—among other things—forbid using compare-and-exchange on
complex numbers. The authors believe this is unacceptable.

Standards Can Only Be Understood Backward, they Must Lived Forward {#life}
------------------------------------------------------------------

We find ourselves unable to use `has_unique_object_representations`, which was
intended for `std::hash` but was hoped to also be usable for our present
usecase. We thus propose a new type trait, tentatively named `has_padding_bits`.

If this sounds familar, that's because it is:

  * [[P0258r2]] introduced `has_unique_object_representations`.
  * [[p0258r1]] proposed `is_contiguous_layout`.
  * [[P0029r0]] proposed `is_uniquely_represented`.
  * [[N3980]] proposed `is_contiguously_hashable`.
  * [[N3333]] proposed `is_contiguous_layout`.
  * [[N4130]] discussed the padding bits issue, and wondered whether a
    `has_padding_bits` trait was sensible. It was reviewed by SG1 in the 2014
    Redmond meeting. Guidance was sought to also resolve [[LWG2334]] as well as
    WG14 DR 431 while keeping C compatibility, but no conclusion was reached.

The reader now also understands this paper's Benjamin Button theme.


Proposed Wording {#word}
================

Issue: add proposed wording. What should it be based on?


Sample Program {#sample}
==============

This program uses compare-and-exchange on a `struct` which has padding bits. It
may loop infinitely, or not.

<xmp>
#include <atomic>
#include <cstring>
#include <new>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <type_traits>

struct Padded {
  char c = 0xFF;
  // Padding here.
  int i = 0xFEEDFACE;
  Padded() = default;
};
typedef std::atomic<Padded> Atomic;
typedef std::aligned_storage<sizeof(Atomic)>::type Storage;

void peek(const char* what, void *into) {
  printf("%16s %08x %08x\n", what, *(int*)into, *(1 + (int*)into));
}

Storage* create() {
  auto* storage = new Storage();
  std::memset(storage, 0xBA, sizeof(Storage));
  asm volatile("":::"memory");
  peek("storage", storage);
  return storage;
}

Atomic* change(Storage* storage) {
  // As if we used an allocator which reuses memory.
  auto* atomic = new(storage) Atomic;
  peek("atomic placed", atomic);
  std::atomic_init(atomic, Padded()); // Which bits go in?
  peek("atomic init", atomic);
  return atomic;
}

Padded infloop_maybe(Atomic* atomic) {
  Padded desired;  // Padding unknown.
  Padded expected; // Could be different.
  peek("desired before", &desired);
  peek("expected before", &expected);
  peek("atomic before", atomic);
  while (
    !atomic->compare_exchange_strong(
      expected,
      desired // Padding bits added and removed here ˙ ͜ʟ˙
  ));
  peek("expected after", &expected);
  peek("atomic after", atomic);
  return expected; // Maybe changed here as well.
}

int main() {
  auto* storage = create();
  auto* atomic = change(storage);
  Padded p = infloop_maybe(atomic);
  peek("main", &p);
  return 0;
}
</xmp>
